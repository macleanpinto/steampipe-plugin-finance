# Finance + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Financial data is queried from multiple sources including [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and the [US SEC Edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) service.

For example:
```sql
select
  symbol,
  short_name,
  regular_market_price
from
  finance_quote
where
  symbol = 'AMZN'
```

```
+--------+------------------+----------------------+
| symbol | short_name       | regular_market_price |
+--------+------------------+----------------------+
| AMZN   | Amazon.com, Inc. | 3467.42              |
+--------+------------------+----------------------+
```
